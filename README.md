# Meduli

## Overview

**Meduli** is a medical assistance website designed to provide preliminary health insights based on user-provided information. The platform allows users to select symptoms along with basic personal details such as age and gender to receive an informational diagnosis suggestion.

## Why i made meduli 
i made meduli as a fun project because i was bored. I first got the ideas when i went ot me relatives house and when were taking about cool medical websites that can diagnose patients. And thats it i got the idea for meduli. An AI power diagnosis engine. I got the ideas for the name meduli as i was trying to shortform MEDICAL EDUCATION LIFE. also it reminds me about the word Medulla(A part of the brain). I  and had a lot of fun making this project.I made meduli about 6 months ago and it was also my fist smooth publish in github.

 **Important Note**: Meduli is only made for personal use please dont use it for treatment of patients.
